    The common concepts present in all the docstrings for the function `add_up(arr)` are:

    1. **Iteration through nested lists**: The function involves iterating through lists within a list.
    2. **Summation of numbers**: The primary task of the function is to sum up the numbers in the nested list structure.
    3. **Handling integers and floats**: The function specifically sums only integer and float types.
    4. **Ignoring non-numerical elements**: Non-numeric types such as strings are ignored during summation.
    5. **Handling missing or invalid data**: Empty spots or errors related to non-numerical data are either explicitly stated as being ignored or implicitly implied to be handled gracefully.

    These concepts indicate that the function is designed to robustly sum numerical values within a potentially mixed-type or sparse nested list.

    The common concepts across all the docstrings in the provided prompts are:

    1. **Base Manipulation**:
       - **List Iteration**: The function iterates through each element in a given list `lst`.
       
    2. **Input Types**:
       - **Handling Strings**: For string elements in the list, the function appends or concatenates the input integer `num` to the end of the string.
       - **Handling Integers**: For integer elements in the list, the function adds the input integer `num` to the element.
       - **Handling Other Types**: Elements that are neither strings nor integers are generally left unmodified.

    3. **Output**:
       - **Returning a New List**: The function either modifies the original list or creates a new list based on the applied transformations.

    4. **Ignored Nested Lists**:
       - **Lists Within Lists**: Lists within the input list are generally ignored and left as they are in the output.

    These concepts outline how the function handles different types of elements in the input list, applying specific transformations to strings and integers, and providing the appropriate output.

    The common concepts in these docstrings are:

    1. **List of Strings**: The function operates on a list of strings (words).

    2. **Ending Substring**: The function takes a second argument, an ending substring (ending).

    3. **Modification of Words**: For each word in the list, the function removes a specific portion of the word and replaces it with 's'.

    4. **Substring Removal**: The ending substring (ending) is removed from each word in the list if it exists.

    5. **Replacement with 's'**: After removing the ending substring from a word, it is replaced with the letter 's'.

    6. **Maintained Structure**: The function maintains the structure of the word as much as possible after removing the ending and appending 's'.

    The specific wording and explanations might differ, but these core concepts are consistently described or implied in all the docstrings.

    Here are the common concepts found in all the docstrings for the `increaseScore` function:

    1. **Handling Negative Input:**
       - All prompts describe turning a negative input into a positive number. This is usually achieved by taking the absolute value.

    2. **Handling Single-Digit Positive Numbers:**
       - If the input is a positive number that is a single digit (i.e., less than 10), there are two distinct but closely related interpretations:
         * Many prompts describe converting it into a two-digit number, often represented as "multiplying by 10" or "adding 0 to the end", effectively making single-digit numbers equal to 10.
         * A few prompts have slight variations, but the resultant value ends up being treated as 10.

    3. **Handling Double-Digit (or Greater) Numbers:**
       - If the input number is greater than or equal to 10, the function adds 1 to the input value.
      
    4. **Returning an Integer:**
       - All prompts specify that the function returns an integer value after processing the input.

    In summary, the common concepts are:
    - Converting negative inputs to their absolute values.
    - Converting single-digit positive numbers to 10.
    - Incrementing numbers greater than or equal to 10 by 1.

    1. **Inputs**:
       - The function takes a list of lists (`board`), which represents a 2D grid or collection of rows.
       - The function also takes a single string (`letter`), used as a target to compare against the elements in the grid.

    2. **Output**:
       - The function returns a boolean value (`True` or `False`).

    3. **Condition for Output**:
       - The function checks for rows (lists within the main list) where all elements match the `letter`.
       - If any row matches this condition, the function returns `True`.
       - If no row matches this condition, the function returns `False`.

    4. **Consistency Check**:
       - The key check involves verifying if all elements in at least one of the lists within the main list are identical to the `letter`.

    5. **Row-wise Examination**:
       - The function performs a horizontal check, implying it examines each individual list (row) in the 2D list structure.

    Concepts common to all the docstrings:
    1. **List of Lists Input**: The function uses a list of lists (2D list) as input.
    2. **String Comparison**: The function compares elements in the lists to a provided string or character.
    3. **Horizontal Check**: The function is concerned with rows of the 2D list (horizontal direction).
    4. **Boolean Return**: The function returns `True` if a row meets the condition, and `False` otherwise.
    5. **Uniformity within Rows**: The condition checked is whether a row contains all identical elements matching the provided string.

    1. *Input Parameters*: All prompts mention two input parameters for the function: a string `s` and an integer `i`.
    2. *Reverse Operation*: The function reverses part of the string `s`.
    3. *Index *Constraint*: The portion of the string that is reversed starts from the beginning and ends at index `i` (either inclusive or exclusive depending on indexing starting point).
    4. *Return Modified String*: The function returns the modified string after performing the reverse operation.
    5. *Concatenation*: Some of the docstrings mention concatenating the reversed section with the remaining part of the string.
    6. *Edge Handling*: If `i` is greater than the length of the string, the entire string is reversed.

    The concepts common to all the docstrings are:

    1. **Input Parameters**:
        - Input is a list of lists, referred to as "mat" in some descriptions.
        - Two integers are provided as additional inputs, often referred to as "i" and "n".

    2. **Index Specification**:
        - One of the integers (commonly "i") is used as an index.

    3. **Value Replacement**:
        - The other integer (commonly "n") is the new value to be inserted.

    4. **Element Replacement**:
        - The value at the specified index "i" in each sublist of the main list (list of lists) is replaced by the integer "n".

    5. **Iteration Through Sublists**:
        - The operation involves iterating through each sublist (inner lists) in the main list.

    6. **Modification of Lists**:
        - Each sublist is modified in place according to the described replacement.

    7. **Scope**:
        - The changes are uniformly applied to all sublists within the main list.

    8. **Return**:
        - The result is the modified list of lists (though some docstrings don’t explicitly mention returning the list, it is implied by context).

    Example Concept Summary:
    - Input: list of lists (`mat`), index (`i`), value (`n`)
    - Process: iterate each sublist in `mat`, replace element at index `i` with `n`
    - Output: modified list of lists

    These consistent points can serve to imply the overall intended functionality of the `edit_col` function.

    The common concepts across all the docstrings describing the `combine` function are:

    1. **Input Lists (l1 and l2)**: The function takes two inputs, l1 and l2, which are both lists of lists.
    2. **Index-Based Combination**: The elements with the same index from l1 and l2 are combined.
    3. **Output as a List of Lists**: The function returns a new list where each element is itself a list that results from combining the respective elements of l1 and l2.

    These concepts appear consistently in the descriptions provided, despite variations in wording and additional details.

    The following concepts are common to all the docstrings in the provided prompts:

    1. **Integer Input**:
       - All descriptions mention that the function takes in an integer as a parameter.

    2. **List of Lists**:
       - The function returns a list of lists (or an array of arrays).
       
    3. **Size of Outer List**:
       - The number of lists in the outer list is equal to the input integer value.

    4. **Inner Lists Content**:
       - Each inner list contains integers ranging from 1 to the input integer value.

    5. **Repetition**:
       - The inner list (containing integers from 1 to the input value) is repeated multiple times, specifically as many times as the integer value.

    These common concepts highlight the function's purpose of creating a matrix-like structure by repeating a sequence of numbers within an array.

    The docstrings provided describe different aspects of the same function. Here are the common concepts among them:

    1. **Input**: The function takes a single input value, typically referred to as `n`.
    2. **Return Type**: The function returns a boolean value (True or False).
    3. **Conditions for Truth**:
       - Several docstrings specify specific values (e.g., 1, 13, 21) that lead to a True return value.
       - One docstring mentions that the function should return True if the input is not 19.
    4. **Comparison with Fibonacci Numbers**:
       - Some docstrings suggest that the function should check if the number is related to Fibonacci numbers or specific values that are Fibonacci-related.

    Overall, the common themes are:
    - The function checks an integer input.
    - The function returns a True or False value.
    - There are specific conditions defined for the input to result in a particular return value (often involving checking against specific numbers or Fibonacci sequence characteristics).

    While the docstrings vary, most seem to converge on checking if the input number matches certain conditions or is part of a specific set.

    The prompts describe a function that replaces specific characters in a string based on a given list and a replacement character. Here are the common concepts found in the docstrings:

    1. *Three inputs*: 
        - **String \(s\)**: The primary string in which replacements will be made.
        - **List of characters \(chars\)**: A list of characters that need to be checked in the string \(s\).
        - **Replacement character \(sep\)**: The character that will replace all occurrences of characters from the list \(chars\) in the string \(s\).

    2. *Replacement process*:
        - The function *iterates* over the string \(s\).
        - For each character in the string \(s\), it checks if the character is present in the list \(chars\).
        - If a character from \(chars\) is found in \(s\), it is replaced by the character \(sep\).

    3. *Outcome*:
        - The function creates and returns a *new string* where all specified characters from \(chars\) in the original string \(s\) are replaced with the character \(sep\).

    Summary of keywords:
    - String replacement
    - List of characters
    - Iteration/loop
    - Character check
    - Replacement character
    - Create and return new string

    Here are the concepts that are common to all the docstrings listed:

    1. **Function Input**:
       - All functions take two parameters: a list of dictionaries (`books`) and a string (`writer`).

    2. **Filtering by Author**:
       - The dictionaries are filtered to include only those where the `author` key's value matches the input string (`writer`).

    3. **Sorting by Year**:
       - The remaining dictionaries are sorted in ascending order based on the value of the `year` key.

    4. **Return Value**:
       - The function returns the updated list of dictionaries after filtering and sorting.

    These concepts are the primary tasks described by all the docstrings for the function `sortedBooks`.

  _response: |-
    The common concepts found in all the docstrings are:

    1. **Input Type**: The function takes in a list of dictionaries.

    2. **Processing of Values**:
       - Each dictionary is processed by dividing the value associated with the key 'wins' by the value associated with the key 'noms'.
       - The resulting value is stored or added as a new key, 'success', in each dictionary.
       - The 'success' value is rounded to two decimal places.

    3. **Sorting**:
       - The dictionaries in the list are reordered or sorted based on the 'success' values.
       - The sorting is in descending order, from highest to lowest 'success' value.

    Additional concepts in some but not all docstrings:
    - Some emphasize the creation of a new dictionary (although this is not necessarily a common practice in the resulting function).
    - One docstring mentions sorting alphabetically based on the 'nominee' key, then reversing the order, which is a less common detail not present in all docstrings.

    Based on these common concepts, you would expect the function to focus on calculating a 'success' metric for each dictionary and then sorting the list based on this calculated metric.

    1. **Filtering by Subject:**
       - Each prompt specifies checking if the subject (generally located at index 2 of the sublists) is "Physics" before proceeding.
       
    2. **Extracting Names:**
       - If the subject is "Physics," the scientist's name (found at index 0 of the sublists) is to be extracted and included in the result list.

    3. **Sorting Criterion:**
       - The concepts mention sorting the extracted names based on the year or number value associated with each scientist, which is located at index 1 of the sublists.

    4. **Return Value:**
       - The final result should be a list of names, sorted according to the sorting criterion.

    5. **List Structure:**
       - Each prompt assumes that the input is a list of lists (sublists), where each sublist contains details about a scientist.
       
    By synthesizing these common concepts, the function can be described as filtering sublists where the field is "Physics," extracting the names from these filtered sublists, and sorting the names based on the numerical value (year, number) associated with them before returning the sorted list of names.

    The common concepts in all the given docstrings are:

    2. **Identify multiples**: The function is focused on finding multiples of the `factor`.

    3. **Range defined by start and stop**: The range for finding multiples starts from `start` and ends at `stop`.

    4. **Inclusive range**: The `stop` number is included in the range for finding multiples.

    5. **Result is a list**: The function generates a list of multiples.

    Combining these concepts, we can deduce that the function's primary goal is to generate a list of numbers that are multiples of a given `factor`, within a specified inclusive range from `start` to `stop`.

    3. **Score Threshold**: Only consider internal lists where the integer score/grade is greater than or equal to 80.
    4. **Sorting**: Sort the internal lists in descending order based on the integer score/grade.
    5. **Limit the Result**: Return a maximum of 5 names.
    6. **Output Type**: The returned result is a list of names (strings).
    7. **Order of Output**: The names in the returned list should correspond to the highest scores down to the lowest (that meet the threshold).

    These concepts ensure that the function processes and filters the input data correctly, sorts it as required, and returns the expected result in an appropriate format.

    Here are the common concepts identified in all the docstrings for the `reverseWords` function:

    1. **Input Type**:
       - The function takes a list of strings as input.

    2. **Reversing Words**:
       - Each word (string) in the list is reversed; the letters in each word are placed in reverse order.

    3. **Alphabetical Sorting**:
       - After reversing the words, the resulting list of reversed strings is sorted in alphabetical order.

    4. **Output Type**:
       - The function returns a list of the modified strings.

    Combining these observations, we can summarize the common steps in the function as:
    1. Accept a list of words.
    2. Reverse each individual word in the list.
    3. Sort the reversed words alphabetically.
    4. Return the sorted list of reversed words.

    The common concepts in the docstrings can be summarized as follows:

    1. **Input Types:** All docstrings mention the function takes in two inputs:
       - A list of integers (`lst`).
       - A single integer (`val`), which represents the power to which each element in the list will be raised.

    2. **Operation:** Each integer in the provided list is raised to the power of the given integer (`val`).

    3. **Output:** 
       - The function returns a new list containing the results of the exponentiation operation performed on each element of the original list.

    ### Common Concepts:
    1. **List of integers as input** (`lst`).
    2. **Single integer as the exponent** (`val`).
    3. **Exponentiation operation:** Raising each element in the list to the power of the given integer.
    4. **Return a new list** containing the results of the exponentiation.

    Sure, let's list the common concepts between the provided docstrings:

    1. **Functionality**:
        - Both functions create a string based on an integer input (`size`).

    2. **Formation of Word**:
        - Each word in the string begins with the letter 'h'.
        - The letter 'a' is appended after 'h', with the number of 'a's depending on the input size.

    3. **Variation in 'a' Count**:
        - The count of 'a's decreases (starting from the given size down to 1).

    4. **Space Separation**:
        - Words in the resultant string are separated by spaces.

    5. **Loop/Iteration**:
        - A loop is used to construct the string by appending 'h' followed by a varying number of 'a's.

    To summarize, the common concepts are:
    1. An integer input `size`.
    2. Words starting with 'h' followed by a variable number of 'a's.
    3. The number of 'a's decreases based on the input size.
    4. Words separated by spaces.
    5. Use of a loop to build the string.
