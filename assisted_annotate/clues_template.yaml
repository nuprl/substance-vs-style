    The following prompts all describe the same function. List the concepts that are common to all the docstrings in the prompts listed below.
    ```
    def laugh(size):
        """
        Write a function which takes an integer size as an input, creates an empty string called laugh, and the uses a for loop to append an h followed by i number a's for each 0<i<=size starting with i = size, append a space before each h except the first h in the string
        """
    ```

    ```
    def laugh(size):
        """
        function adds 'a' to every 'h' based on input and will lower amount of 'a'. Function also adds a space between every 'ha' except the last one
        """
    ```

      1. *repetition*: the function returns a string with a repeating pattern or uses a loop
      2. *space separation*: the returned string uses spaces to separate each word
      3. *prefix h*: the returned string has an 'h' in front of every word
      4. *size-dependent a's*: in every returned word, the 'h' is followed by repeated letter 'a', with the number of 'a's dependent on the position of the word
      5. *reverse order*: the first word has 'size' repeated 'a's, and this goes down by 1 with each word
      6. *down to 1:* the final word has 1 letter 'a'
