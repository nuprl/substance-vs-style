    The revised prompt includes the same information as the original with the addition of a new feature: the function returns the updated dictionary.

    1. There is no change – both prompts specify that the function adds `word` and `line_number` to `map` (Concept 1).
    2. There is no change – both prompts specify that `line_number` will be a list in the dictionary (Concept 2).
    3. There is no change – neither prompt specifies checking if `word` is already a key (Concept 3).
    4. The second prompt adds that the function returns the dictionary (Concept 4).

    The second prompt simplifies the explanation but retains the same overall concept. 

    The analysis shows:

    1. **Add to map**: This concept remains the same in both prompts, though rephrased with less detail. (l1)
    2. **List of line numbers**: This concept is retained but is less detailed in the second prompt. (l2)
