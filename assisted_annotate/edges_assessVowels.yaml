    The second prompt adds the step of making all characters lowercase before extracting the vowels. This alters the original concept of preserving the case of vowels.

    In the revised prompt:

    1. The concept of making all characters lowercase is removed.
    2. The concept of ensuring that both uppercase and lowercase versions of vowels are accounted for is added.

    The specific changes are as follows:

    - The first prompt mentions "make all characters lowercase", which is removed in the second prompt. This relates to the list containing uppercase vowels as well.
    - The second prompt specifically states, "making sure to account for both uppercase and lowercase versions of the vowels," which adds the concept of including both cases for vowels.

    In the revised prompt, the concept of extracting values from the input is changed to specifically extracting vowels, which adds more specificity.

    1. argument s is a string: This is implied and present in both prompts but with no explicit mention in either.
    2. result is a list of strings: The mention of a list containing strings remains unaltered in level of detail.
    3. result is the vowels present in the argument: This concept is added in the second prompt, specifying that it targets vowels.
    4. result has both upper and lower case vowels: Not mentioned in either prompt.

    In the revised prompt, there are a few changes:

    2. The inclusion of "I" introduces the concept of both upper case vowels (incomplete list).
    3. The original prompt does not specify upper or lower case, while the revised prompt mentions upper cases explicitly.

    3. result is the vowels present in the argument: Reworded with less detail in the second prompt.
    4. result has both upper and lower case vowels: The specific vowels "a", "e", "I", or "u" from the original prompt are replaced with a generic reference to "vowels" in the revised prompt, losing the detail about specific vowel cases.
