    There are no significant semantic changes between the two prompts; the only difference is the phrasing from "a dict" to "a dictionary," which is a trivial rewrite.

    In the revised prompt, the condition for checking "Aspen" changes from being defined in the dictionary to being an integer greater than 0. However, the prompt still implies checking the presence of "Aspen" but now with a different condition (checking the value instead of just the key). The output remains the same.
