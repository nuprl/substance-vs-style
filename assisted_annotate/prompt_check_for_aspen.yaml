    I will show you a pair of prompts written by a student, where is second is a
    revision of the first. I will also give you a numbered list of concepts. I
    want you to label the concepts that were added, removed, or reworded in the
    second prompt.

    Respond with an analysis of the changes and then summarize the changes by
    how each concept is changed followed by the concept number.

    - a: the concept is not in the first prompt, but is added in the second prompt
    - d: the concept is in the first prompt, but is removed in the second prompt
    - l:  the concept is in both prompts, but is rewritten with less detail in the second prompt
    - m: the concept is in both prompts, but is rewritten with more detail in the second prompt

    There is also a special tag that should only be used when none of the
    other tags apply.

    - 0: no difference or trivial rewrite (semantically equivalent rewrite, with no change to the concepts)

    Conclude the analysis with a summary that looks like this

    Summary:

    ```yaml
    - a1
    - d2
    - l3
    - m4

    The student started with this prompt:

    ```
    def laugh(size):
      """
      a function have initial input as 'ha' when  input of size(int) is 1, when size+= 1 from 1, 'ha' will gain one more 'a'
      """
    ```

    And turned it into the following prompt:
    
    ```
    def laugh(size):
        """
        a function have initial input as 'ha' when  input of size(int) is 1, when size+= 1 from 1, 'ha' will gain one more 'a' and have another 'ha' with the original length of 'a'
        """
    ```

    These are the concepts:

    - 1: prefix h
    - 2: reverse order
    - 3: number of a-s is based on size
    - 4: space separation
    - 5: down to 1
    - 6: repetition

    The second prompt adds the text "and have another 'ha' with the original length of 'a'". This introduces the idea that there is repetition in the result, which is not clear in the first prompt.

    Summary:

    ```yaml
    - a6
    ```

    The student started with this prompt:
  
    ```
    def laugh(size):
        """
        This function prints ha 
        """
    ```
  
    And turned it into the following prompt:
  
    ```   
    def laugh(size):
        """
        This function prints a word
        """
    ```

    These are the concepts:

    - 1: prefix h
    - 2: reverse order
    - 3: number of a-s is based on size
    - 4: space separation
    - 5: down to 1 (must be explicit)
    - 6: repetition

    In the revised prompt, the concept of printing "ha" is replaced by the more
    generic phrase "prints a word".

    Summary:

    ```yaml
    - d1
    ``` 
- role: user
  content: |
    The student started with this prompt:
    
    ```
    $prompt_from
    ```
    
    And turned it into the following prompt:
    
    ```
    $prompt_to
    ```

    These are the concepts:

    - 1: **Dictionary Input**: The function takes a dictionary as an input.
    - 2: **Key Check**: The function checks for the presence of the key "Aspen" in the dictionary.
    - 3: **Output Based on Check**: The function outputs "Yup" if "Aspen" is found as a key in the dictionary, and "Nope" if it is not found. Capitalization is very important.
