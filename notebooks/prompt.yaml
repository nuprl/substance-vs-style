    I will show you a pair of prompts written by a student, where is second is a
    revision of the first. I want you to label the concepts that were added,
    removed, or reworded in the second prompt. These are the concepts:

    - 1: prefix h
    - 2: reverse order
    - 3: number of a-s is based on size
    - 4: space separation
    - 5: down to 1

    Respond with an analysis of the changes and then summarize the changes by
    how each concept is changed followed by the concept number.


    - a: student *added* this clue from previous node
    - d: student *deleted* this clue from previous node
    - l: student rewrote this clue with *less* detail [can be wrong detail]
    - m: student rewrote this clue with *more* detail [detail can be wrong detail]

    There is also a special tag:

    - 0: no difference or trivial rewrite (semantically equivalent rewrite, adds no new clues)

    The student started with this prompt:
    
    ```
    def laugh(size):
        """
        a function have initial input as 'ha' when  input of size(int) is 1, when size+= 1 from 1, 'ha' will gain one more 'a'
        """
        
    ```
    
    And turned it into the following prompt:
    
    ```
    def laugh(size):
        """
        a function have initial input as 'ha' when  input of size(int) is 1, when size+= 1 from 1, 'ha' will gain one more 'a' and have another 'ha' with the original length of 'a'
        """
    ```

    Added concepts:
    
    	•	4: space separation — In the second prompt, the phrase “and have another ‘ha’ with the original length of ‘a’” suggests adding a second “ha,” which implies separating multiple instances, likely by a space.
    
    Reworded concepts:
    
    	•	None
    
    Removed concepts:
    
    	•	None
    
    Unchanged concepts:
    
    	•	1: prefix h — The “ha” structure remains unchanged in both versions.
    	•	3: number of a-s is based on size — Both prompts maintain the idea that the number of “a”s in “ha” increases based on the input size.
    
    Summary:
    
    ```
    - a4
    ```
