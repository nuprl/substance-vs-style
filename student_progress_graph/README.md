## Graph experiment

Work from codex stderr/stdout + diffs

[X] run each test/print independently

- for each problem, create a graph where:
    - NODES: clusters of possible stdout/stderr outputs
    - EDGES: diffs
    - plot paths for each student that starts with failing prompt and ends with successful prompt

- create a visualization

RQs:
- when are students more likely to be stuck in loops
- what is most common trajectory
- what is most efficient trajectory
etc.
