## Graph experiment

Work from codex stderr/stdout + diffs

[X] run each test/print independently

- for each problem, create a graph where:
    [X] NODES: clusters of possible stdout/stderr output combinations
    [X] EDGES: diffs
    [X] plot paths for each student that starts with failing prompt and ends with successful prompt

- create a visualization

RQs:
- when are students more likely to be stuck in loops
- what is most common trajectory
- what is most efficient trajectory
etc.
